# neumi_esp32_websocket

A project for real-time communication between an ESP32 microcontroller and web/mobile clients using WebSocket technology.

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains firmware and client examples for enabling reliable, low-latency messaging between an ESP32 device and external applications. It is designed for IoT, robotics, sensor networks, and scenarios where instant feedback or streaming data is required.

## 🎨 Design Principles

- **Real-time Communication:**  
  Utilizes WebSocket for bidirectional, event-driven messaging between the ESP32 and clients.

- **Modular Firmware:**  
  ESP32 code is organized for easy expansion, allowing custom sensors/actuators to be added as components.

- **Cross-Platform Clients:**  
  Includes sample web and mobile clients to demonstrate interoperability and ease of integration.

- **Robust Error Handling:**  
  Connection and data integrity are managed with reconnect logic and validation.

- **Documentation First:**  
  All modules and API endpoints are documented for rapid onboarding and extension.

## 📡 How It Works

1. **ESP32 boots and connects to WiFi.**
2. **WebSocket server starts on ESP32.**
3. **Clients (web/mobile) connect via WebSocket and authenticate (if required).**
4. **Real-time data (sensor readings, controls, etc.) are exchanged instantly.**
5. **Connection status and logs are available via the web client or serial output.**

## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- ESP32 board (any variant)
- PlatformIO or ESP-IDF toolchain
- Node.js (for web client)
- [Optional] React Native/Flutter setup for mobile client

### Quick Start

1. Clone the repo:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rorando111/neumi_esp32_websocket.git
   ```

2. Build and flash ESP32 firmware:  
   ```bash
   cd esp32
   # For PlatformIO
   pio run --target upload
   ```

3. Start the web client:  
   ```bash
   cd web_client
   npm install
   npm start
   ```

4. Connect your browser/mobile app to the ESP32’s IP address and port.
